Below is an **illustrative JSON-based data structure** that encompasses the broader **system architectures** you’ve mentioned, including “Primaries Constructions” (physical/structural), “Energy Grids and Source,” “Computing Networks,” “Green Motors” (propulsion), “Technical Data,” and a nod to “Data Science -> Industrial Revolution.” This markup aims to provide a high-level, **multi-domain** view of an advanced aerospace or industrial ecosystem, highlighting how these areas interrelate.

> **Note:** You can use or adapt this structure to integrate into your existing frameworks (for example, the BOM or `AircraftSystem` classes), store it in a database, or auto-generate documentation.

### **Explanation**

1. **Top-Level Fields**:
   - **Program / Model / Version**: Identifies the overarching program (e.g., GAIA AIR) and the specific aircraft or environment (AmPel-360XWLRGA), plus a version for internal reference.
2. **Domains**:
   - A list capturing major categories (System Architectures, Primaries Constructions, Energy, etc.). Each domain has:
     - **DomainName**: E.g., “GREEN MOTORS (PROPULSION).”
     - **Description**: Brief rationale or scope.
     - **SubElements**: Items within that domain.
3. **SubElements**:
   - Each has **Name**, **Category**, **Description**, and **KeyAttributes**. 
   - **KeyAttributes** is flexible, holding compliance references, sustainability notes, lifecycle data, or anything else needed for your engineering approach.

---

## **Use Cases**

1. **Data Exchange**: You can import/export this JSON into your internal databases, PLM/ERP systems, or BOM expansions for advanced analytics (like QAOA, AI maintenance scheduling).
2. **Documentation Generation**: Tools could parse this JSON and auto-generate sections in Markdown or a structured doc (Sphinx, LaTeX) for compliance or stakeholder review.
3. **Validation and Auditing**: JSON Schema or custom scripts can verify each domain has correct references (e.g., “FAR/CS” or “DO-178C” for software) to ensure no element is missing key regulatory data.

---

## **Tips for Further Expansion**

- **Linking to BOM**: The `KeyAttributes` could reference `BOM IDs`, cost/wieght references, or even sub-assembly info for cross-referencing with your BOM or `Assembly` classes.
- **LifeCycle / Maintenance**: Add fields for recommended MRO intervals, spares management, or tooling requirements.
- **Security / Ciberseguridad**: Especially relevant for computing or propulsion controls. Could add “SecurityLevel” or “ThreatMitigations” in `KeyAttributes`.
- **Multi-Language or Localization**: If needed, fields like `Description` or `Name` could store multiple languages, or you could have separate JSON translations.

### Conclusion

By structuring your **System Architectures**, **Primaries Constructions** (airframe), **Energy Grids**, **Computing Networks**, **Green Motors (propulsion)**, **Technical Data**, and **Data Science** domains in a single JSON markup, you gain a **holistic, flexible** representation of your entire aerospace project. This fosters better **integration**, **traceability**, and the potential for advanced analytics or continuous improvement as you progress in the **Industrial Revolution** synergy.$(document).ready(function() {
