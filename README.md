- **\(P_{\text{cargas}}\):** Potencia consumida por otros subsistemas.
- **\(P_{\text{pérdidas}}\):** Pérdidas en la distribución eléctrica.

#### **3.6 Propulsión Central (S_central)**
Genera empuje utilizando energía eléctrica e hidrógeno.

**Empuje Total:**
\[ F_{\text{total}} = F_{\text{eléctrico}} + F_{\text{hidrógeno}} \]

**Empuje Eléctrico:**
\[ F_{\text{eléctrico}} = \eta_{\text{motor}} \cdot \frac{P_{\text{motor}}}{v} \]

**Donde:**
- **\(\eta_{\text{motor}}\):** Eficiencia del motor eléctrico.
- **\(P_{\text{motor}}\):** Potencia eléctrica suministrada al motor.
- **\(v\):** Velocidad del flujo de aire (m/s).

**Empuje por Hidrógeno:**
\[ F_{\text{hidrógeno}} = \dot{m}_{\text{H}_2} \cdot v_e \]

**Donde:**
- **\(v_e\):** Velocidad de escape de los gases (m/s).

### **4. Integración de los Subsistemas en el Modelo Global**

#### **4.1 Variables de Estado (\(\mathbf{x}\))**
Definimos el vector de estado del sistema:
\[ \mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} \dot{m}_{\text{H}_2} \\ T_{\text{termal}} \\ P_{\text{motor}} \\ F_{\text{total}} \end{bmatrix} \]

#### **4.2 Ecuaciones Dinámicas del Sistema**
- **Producción de Hidrógeno:**
  \[ \frac{d\dot{m}_{\text{H}_2}}{dt} = \eta_{\text{elec}} \cdot \frac{P_{\text{elec}}}{E_{\text{H}_2}} \]
  
- **Gestión Térmica:**
  \[ \frac{dT_{\text{termal}}}{dt} = \frac{1}{m_{\text{fluid}} \cdot c_p} \left( Q_{\text{gen}} - Q_{\text{utilizado}} \right) \]
  
- **Balance de Potencia:**
  \[ P_{\text{motor}} = P_{\text{in}} - P_{\text{elec}} - P_{\text{pérdidas}} \]
  
- **Empuje Total:**
  \[ F_{\text{total}} = \eta_{\text{motor}} \cdot \frac{P_{\text{motor}}}{v} + \dot{m}_{\text{H}_2} \cdot v_e \]
  
- **Control del Sistema:**
  \[ \mathbf{u}(t) = \mathcal{F}(\mathbf{x}(t), D_{\text{in}}) \]

### **5. Análisis del Sistema**

#### **5.1 Estabilidad y Control**
Las Redes Neuronales Distribuidas implementan algoritmos de control avanzados para mantener el sistema en condiciones óptimas de operación.

**Objetivo de Control:**
Minimizar una función de costo \( J \) que incluye términos como consumo de energía, emisiones y desviación del empuje deseado.

**Función de Costo:**
\[ J = \int_{t_0}^{t_f} \left( w_1 \cdot (F_{\text{total}} - F_{\text{deseado}})^2 + w_2 \cdot P_{\text{total}} + w_3 \cdot \dot{m}_{\text{emisiones}} \right) dt \]

**Donde:**
- **\(w_1, w_2, w_3\):** Ponderaciones asignadas a cada término.

#### **5.2 Simulación y Validación**
Se recomienda realizar simulaciones del sistema utilizando software especializado para validar el modelo y optimizar los parámetros de control.

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const swaggerUi = require('swagger-ui-express');
   const YAML = require('yamljs');
   const path = require('path');

   const swaggerDocument = YAML.load(path.join(__dirname, 'docs/api/swagger.yaml'));
   const app = express();

   // Servir Swagger UI en /api-docs
   app.use('/api-docs', swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(swaggerDocument));

   // Otros endpoints...
   app.get('/routes/optimize', (req, res) => {
     const { departure, arrival } = req.query;
     // Lógica de optimización...
     res.json({
       optimized_route: {
         departure,
         arrival,
         fuel_savings: "18%",
         estimated_time: "6h 45m"
       }
     });
   });

   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
   app.listen(PORT, () => {
     console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
   });
   ```

## 📚 Guía Adicional para Mejorar la Documentació.

### 🧮 Integración de Notación Matemática con LaTeX en Markdown

Markdown no soporta directamente la notación matemática, pero puedes integrarla utilizando sintaxis de LaTeX. A continuación, se detallan las formas de hacerlo:

#### 1. Matemáticas en Línea (Inline Math)

Utiliza signos de dólar simples `$...$` para incluir expresiones matemáticas dentro del texto.

**Ejemplo:**

```markdown
El ahorro de combustible es de $18\%$, lo que representa una mejora significativa en la eficiencia operativa.
```

**Resultado:**

El ahorro de combustible es de $18\%$, lo que representa una mejora significativa en la eficiencia operativa.

#### 2. Matemáticas en Bloque (Block Math)

Para expresiones matemáticas más complejas o destacadas, utiliza dobles signos de dólar `$$...$$` para centrar la fórmula en una nueva línea.

**Ejemplo:**

```markdown
La eficiencia de la ruta optimizada se puede calcular mediante la siguiente fórmula:

$$
\eta = \frac{\text{Combustible ahorrado}}{\text{Combustible total utilizado}} \times 100
$$
```

**Resultado:**

La eficiencia de la ruta optimizada se puede calcular mediante la siguiente fórmula:

$$
\eta = \frac{\text{Combustible ahorrado}}{\text{Combustible total utilizado}} \times 100
$$

#### 3. Ecuaciones Numeradas

Si necesitas referenciar ecuaciones específicas, puedes numerarlas utilizando `\begin{equation} ... \end{equation}`.

**Ejemplo:**

```markdown
La optimización de rutas se basa en la minimización de la función de costo:

\begin{equation}
    C(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i x_i
\end{equation}
```

**Resultado:**

La optimización de rutas se basa en la minimización de la función de costo:

\begin{equation}
    C(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i x_i
\end{equation}

#### 4. Matrices y Otros Elementos Avanzados

Para representar matrices, vectores u otros elementos avanzados, utiliza entornos específicos de LaTeX.

**Ejemplo de Matriz:**

```markdown
La matriz de covarianza se define como:

$$
\Sigma = \begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{11} & \sigma_{12} \\
\sigma_{21} & \sigma_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
```

**Resultado:**

La matriz de covarianza se define como:

$$
\Sigma = \begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{11} & \sigma_{12} \\
\sigma_{21} & \sigma_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

---

## 🛠 Aplicación en tu README.md

A continuación, se muestran áreas específicas de tu README donde podrías considerar agregar notación matemática para mejorar la claridad y profesionalismo:

### 1. Optimización de Rutas

Explicar brevemente el algoritmo de optimización utilizando fórmulas matemáticas.

**Ejemplo:**

```markdown
La optimización de rutas se realiza mediante el Algoritmo de Optimización Cuántica Aproximada (QAOA), el cual busca minimizar el consumo de combustible $F$ y el tiempo de vuelo $T$. La función de costo se define como:

$$
C(\mathbf{x}) = \alpha F(\mathbf{x}) + \beta T(\mathbf{x})
$$

donde $\alpha$ y $\beta$ son coeficientes de ponderación que equilibran la importancia del ahorro de combustible y la reducción del tiempo de vuelo.
```

### 2. Reducción de Emisiones de Carbono

Incluir una fórmula que muestre cómo la optimización contribuye a la reducción de emisiones.

**Ejemplo:**

```markdown
La reducción de emisiones de carbono $E$ se calcula como:

$$
E = F_{\text{sin optimizar}} - F_{\text{optimizado}}
$$

donde $F_{\text{sin optimizar}}$ es el combustible consumido sin optimización y $F_{\text{optimizado}}$ es el combustible consumido tras la optimización.
```

### 3. Predicciones de Seguridad Basadas en IA

Explicar el modelo de predicción utilizando una ecuación de probabilidad.

**Ejemplo:**

```markdown
La probabilidad de un fallo $P(F)$ se estima utilizando un modelo de regresión logística:

$$
P(F) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \dots + \beta_n x_n)}}
$$

donde $\beta_0, \beta_1, \dots, \beta_n$ son los coeficientes del modelo y $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ son las variables independientes.
```

## 📌 Recomendaciones para Implementar Notación Matemática

1. **Consistencia en el Uso de LaTeX:**
   - Mantén una sintaxis consistente al usar símbolos matemáticos.
   - Asegúrate de cerrar correctamente los delimitadores `$` o `$$`.

2. **Claridad y Simplicidad:**
   - Evita fórmulas excesivamente complejas en el README principal.
   - Si una explicación detallada es necesaria, considera trasladarla a la documentación técnica en `docs/`.

3. **Referencias y Enlaces:**
   - Si utilizas símbolos o fórmulas estándar, proporciona enlaces a recursos externos para mayor claridad.
   - Ejemplo: Puedes enlazar a [Wikipedia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algoritmo_de_optimización_cuántica) para explicar el QAOA.

4. **Pruebas de Renderizado:**
   - Verifica que las expresiones matemáticas se rendericen correctamente en GitHub.
   - Utiliza vistas previas o plataformas como [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) para comprobar el formato.
