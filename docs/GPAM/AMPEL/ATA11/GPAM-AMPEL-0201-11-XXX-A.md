## Introduction

The weight and balance of an aircraft are critical factors that affect its performance, stability, and safety. Proper management of weight and balance ensures optimal flight characteristics and compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Weight and Balance Limits

The following table provides the weight and balance limits for the aircraft:

| Parameter            | Value          |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Maximum Ramp Weight  | 268,900 kg     |
| Maximum Takeoff Weight| 268,000 kg     |
| Maximum Landing Weight| 213,200 kg     |
| Maximum Zero Fuel Weight | 200,000 kg  |
| Minimum Flight Weight | 120,000 kg    |

## Center of Gravity (CG) Limits

The center of gravity (CG) limits are defined as a percentage of the Mean Aerodynamic Chord (MAC). The following table provides the CG limits for different configurations:

| Configuration           | Fwd CG Limit (% MAC) | Aft CG Limit (% MAC) |
|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Baseline                | [COMPLETAR]          | [COMPLETAR]          |
| MRW - Forward CG        | 26                   | 33.1                 |
| MRW - Aft CG            | 26                   | 33.1                 |
| Lighter Configuration   | 20                   | 40                   |
| A/C Jacked              | -                    | -                    |

**Note:** %MAC refers to the percentage of the Mean Aerodynamic Chord. The MAC is defined in document [Placeholder: Link to document defining MAC].
