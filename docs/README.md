### Executive Summary

This whitepaper presents the Quantum Aerospace Operating System (QAOS) designed for the AMPEL360-BWB-Q100 aircraft. QAOS delivers a modular, ethically governed, and quantum-enhanced computational substrate for autonomous aerospace operations. It integrates quantum resource allocation, digital twin orchestration, and ethical decision-making via the AMEDEO framework.

### 1. Background and Motivation

Modern aerospace systems face rising demands for computational efficiency, adaptability, and trustworthiness. Traditional avionics architectures struggle to meet the real-time requirements of quantum-enhanced optimization, autonomy, and dynamic system coordination.

QAOS addresses these challenges by leveraging quantum hardware (QPU-1 to QPU-3), a dedicated digital twin system, agent-based workload orchestration, and ethical invariants enforced by the AMEDEO protocol.

---

### 2. System Overview

QAOS comprises the following subsystems:

- **Quantum Resource Allocator (QRA):** Assigns quantum workloads across QPUs based on priority, resource availability, and mission phase.
- **Agent Manager (AM):** Supervises resource optimization, workload management, and system monitoring agents.
- **Digital Twin Interface (DTI):** Enables real-time synchronization between physical systems and simulated representations.
- **AMEDEO Framework:** Provides ethical vetting, constraints enforcement, and traceable decision logs.
- **QAOS Console:** Operator interface for workload status, alerts, and overrides.

All components communicate via a certified avionics bus (ARINC 664) and share synchronized state via the Digital Twin Server (DTS).

### 4. Software Architecture

- **QRA Core (Python):** Implements scheduling, allocation, monitoring
- **Agents (Python):** Extend BaseAgent and include ResourceOptimizationAgent, WorkloadManagementAgent, MonitoringAgent
- **AMEDEO Client (Python):** Interfaces with ethical constraints engine
- **QAOS Console (React + FastAPI):** Visualization, control, audit log access

All components are containerized using OpenShift 4.12 and adhere to DO-330 tool qualification guidelines.

### 5. Ethical Governance with AMEDEO

AMEDEO ensures all resource allocations, workload decisions, and optimization actions comply with predefined ethical constraints and mission goals.

- **Constraint Types:** Safety, fairness, energy efficiency, autonomy respect
- **Decision History:** Stored in immutable logs with cryptographic signatures
- **Override Protection:** Prevents unethical behavior even under operator pressure

---

### 6. Test Framework and Validation

QAOS includes:

- **Workload Generator Framework:** Simulates scenarios, flight phases, and system degradation
- **Quantum Circuit Generator:** Synthesizes circuits based on workload profile
- **Distribution Controller:** Manages load submission to QRA
- **Test Runner / Report Tools:** Validates acceptance rate, latency, and ethical conformance

**Test Suites:**

- Normal Operation
- Emergency Scenarios
- Performance Stress Tests

---

### 7. Deployment Strategy

- **Signed YAML Configurations:** FCC, QPU, QPUM modules signed via SHA384 + PGP
- **Console Integration:** Live dashboards for QPU, workloads, ethics events, alerts
- **Secure Export:** AES-256-CBC export to hardware vaults and maintenance tablets
- **Rollback Ready:** Deployment with automated validation and revert
